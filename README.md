## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Testing

```bash
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## 🎨 Theming

The boilerplate includes a comprehensive theme system using CSS variables. Customize colors, spacing, typography, and more in `src/styles/theme.css`:

```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #0070f3;
  --color-secondary: #7c3aed;
  /* ... more variables */
}
```

Dark mode is automatically enabled based on system preferences. Customize dark mode styles in the `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` section.

## 📝 Example Components

The boilerplate includes a few example components to get you started:

- **Button** - Accessible button component with variants
- **Card** - Card container component

These serve as examples of best practices for component structure and CSS Modules usage.

## 🧪 Testing

Tests are located in the `tests/` directory. Example tests are included for:

- Utility functions (`tests/utils.test.ts`)
- Components (`tests/components/Button.test.tsx`)

### Writing Tests

```typescript
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import { Button } from "@/components/Button";

describe("Button", () => {
  it("renders correctly", () => {
    render(<Button>Click me</Button>);
    expect(screen.getByText("Click me")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### TypeScript

TypeScript configuration is in `tsconfig.json`. Path aliases are configured with `@/*` pointing to `src/*`.

### ESLint

ESLint configuration extends Next.js recommended rules. Customize in `eslint.config.mjs`.

### Jest

Jest is configured to work with TypeScript and React Testing Library. Configuration is in `jest.config.js`.
